# Hackathon Judging Criteria

## Core Judging Criteria (75% total)

- **Feature Completeness (17%)** - How much functional product was built in the limited time
- **Architecture Design (17%)** - System design and architectural decisions (code implementation not evaluated)
- **Market Strategy (12%)** - Quality of market research and go-to-market strategy demonstration
- **MVP Viability (12%)** - Whether the product demonstrates core value proposition effectively
- **User Experience (12%)** - How polished and usable the product feels despite time limits
- **Infrastructure & DevOps (5%)** - Deployment strategy, CI/CD workflows, infrastructure planning, and operational considerations

## Project Organization (10% total)

- **Documentation Quality (5%)** - Accurate project description, well-documented workflows, and clear "how-to" examples _(extra weight given due to architecture-focused evaluation)_ with a bonus for using of known tools and frameworks .
- **Project Management (5%)** - Evidence of roadmap planning and internal management, bonus for use of tools like github projects.

## To Be Developed (15% total)

- _Additional criteria to be defined based on hackathon theme and specific requirements_

## Bonus Point Categories

- **Iteration Cycles** - Evidence of rapid prototyping and user feedback incorporation
- **Technical Efficiency** - Smart architectural choices using existing tools, APIs, or frameworks
- **Scalability Considerations** - Architecture choices that enable future rapid development

## Key Evaluation Principles

**Quality over Quantity** - Teams are rewarded for thoughtful, well-architected solutions rather than feature bloat. A smaller set of well-designed, properly documented features will score higher than numerous poorly planned implementations.

**Architecture-Focused Assessment** - System design and architectural decisions take precedence over code quality. Strong documentation becomes crucial as it demonstrates architectural thinking and enables evaluation without code review.

## Summary

These criteria emphasize **product velocity** through sustainable development practices - rewarding teams that can deliver substantial, well-architected functionality while maintaining clear project organization and documentation standards.
