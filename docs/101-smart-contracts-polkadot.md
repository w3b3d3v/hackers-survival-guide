## üöÄ Smart Contract Development on Polkadot

Polkadot enables **smart contract deployment** via **PolkaVM**. This allows using familiar **Ethereum tools** and **libraries** while leveraging Polkadot‚Äôs robust ecosystem. **PolkaVM** is live on Passet Hub, the Polkadot community testnet. ‚úÖ

Please provide **feedback** on your experience deploying smart contracts on Polkadot using this [feedback form](https://forms.gle/BhL5ZCaFMUvSipos8).

_Refer to the [**known issues**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j5hnQZRqlbVagW28dC24OVAF8uRih5jWubBxy5PlMYc/edit?usp=sharing) document if you're running into issues deploying contracts or using any of the tools below. If you have a new bug or problem, please raise an issue in the [Contracts Bug tracker](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues) on Github._

### üìö Solidity Development Environments

There are multiple development environments already available for Polkadot smart contract development. Here are some of the most popular ones:

- üñ•Ô∏è [**Polkadot Remix IDE**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/remix/) - a web-based IDE that allows you to write, test, and deploy smart contracts directly in your browser. It's integrated with compatible chains: you can deploy right from the browser

- ‚öíÔ∏è [**Hardhat**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/hardhat/) - a popular Ethereum development environment that can be used for Polkadot smart contract development with the help of custom plugins
- ü§† [**Foundry**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/dev-environments/foundry/) - a smart contract development toolchain that manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with thec ontracts.

### ü¶Ä Rust Contracts

Besides **Solidity**, you can also write smart contracts in Rust using **ink!** &mdash; the go-to language for Rust-based smart contract development on Polkadot. Check out the [**ink! Docs**](https://use.ink/6.x) (compatible with PolkaVM from v6 ) to get started.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Contract Interaction Libraries

Several libraries can be used to interact with smart contracts deployed on Polkadot for both Solidity and Rust.

**Solidity**

- üîµ [**Ethers.js**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/ethers-js/)

- ‚ö° [**viem**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/viem/)

- üåê [**Web3.js**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-js/)

- üêç [**Web3.py**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/web3-py/)

- üßô [**Wagmi**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/libraries/wagmi/)

**ink!**

- ü•∏ [**PAPI**](https://papi.how/ink)

### üîë How to Connect to Polkadot Hub Testnet

You can use any **Ethereum-compatible wallet** wallet to connect to Polkadot Hub Testnet. Follow the [Connect your Wallet](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/connect-to-polkadot/) guide to connect using MetaMask. We also recommend using [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/), which is built for both Polkadot and Ethereum.

```
Testnet details:
* Network name: Passet Hub
* Chain ID: 420420421
* RPC URL: https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io
* Block Explorer URL: https://blockscout-passet-hub.parity-testnet.parity.io/
```

### üíß Polkadot Faucet

Need **testnet tokens**? Get some from the [**Testnet Faucet**](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111) üíß

> **Note:** Make sure you've selected the **Passet Hub** chain on the **Paseo** network!

### üèÜ Starter Templates

Jumpstart your **smart contract dApp** with these templates:

- [**create-polkadot-dapp**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-polkadot-dapp?activeTab=readme) - a scaffolding tool to generate project boilerplates. Explore the `react-solidity` template located in the `templates` folder which comes pre-configured with **React, Tailwind CSS, and Ethers.js** for frontend interaction with your smart contracts

- [**hardhat-polkadot-example**](https://github.com/UtkarshBhardwaj007/hardhat-polkadot-example) - a demo for how to use Hardhat with Polkadot.

### Vibe coding with AI: LLM configuration helper

- If using AI tools like LLMs, remember to direct them to use the most [up-to-date documentation](https://docs.polkadot.com/).

- Especially if you are using Claude, [this document](https://www.kusamahub.com/downloads/LLMCONTRACTS.md) contains configuration settings for using the testnet to deploy smart contracts, and we recommend informing your LLM to refer to it.
